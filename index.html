  <p>The Arcane Engineering Corps also utilizes a unique program called Mage Master. Mage Master  is a proprietary suite that includes the necessary support structure to handle MageScript. By default, Mage Master is capable of significant customization through extensions. The most common extensions are focused on specific schools of magic, like Abjuration or Conjuration. If you opt for the Pro version, you receive access to the various types of prototype magic lexicon in development. Lastly, the Enterprise version offers all this at scale with access to the aether cloud - real time and multi-dimensional infrastructure as a service.</p>
